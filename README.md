# Bed_from_angle_iron

The idea behind this simple bed design stems from the length of available stock. Since stock is 20ft long, we are limited in design by this fact. In this design we use two stocks 2" angle iron with 1/8" thickness. The total available length is therefore 40ft. The frame and footing have been made extra strong to support other large loads to be rested on or hung below the frame. This frame can be alternatively used as support for other larger machinery. However, user must perform their own load tests and failure mode analysis before such applications.
